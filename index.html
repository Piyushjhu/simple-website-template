            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
           I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Johns Hopkins University with extensive 
experience in developing automated experimental facilities, researching 
high-velocity impact loadings, and exploring shock responses in advanced 
materials. With a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of 
Rhode Island and a strong background in composite fabrication and computational 
mechanics, I aim to innovate and lead in the field of extreme material 
applications.
